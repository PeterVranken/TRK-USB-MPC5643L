STMicroelectronics have MCUs, which are obviously based on the same source
as the Freescale MPC series. The STMicroelectronics SPC56EL60 seems to be
equivalent and the SPC56EL70l5 nearly equivalent to our Freescale
MPS5643L. This opens a new source of sample code and documentation.

Note, the license agreement of STMicroelectronics restricts their code to
the execution on their own chips only.
