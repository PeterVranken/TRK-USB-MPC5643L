//
// This is a template group file for StringTemplate V4, see www.stringtemplate.org. It is
// applied to generate the repetitive parts of the linker script, i.e. those elements,
// which are needed for each process. The use of a template avoids typical errors by slip
// of the pen.
//   Considerations:
//   Main requirement is the limit of having no more than three memory chunks per process.
// Most common would be six: normal addressing, SDA and SDA2 addressing, each with data and
// bss. We can reduce this to three by placing the data and bss parts immediately one after
// another so that both together form one chunk. Now we have one chunk for normal, SDA and
// SDA2 addressed data.
//   Normally, one has one output section per normal/SDA/SDA2 addressing and data/bss, i.e.
// six output sections. This is a contradiction to having alternating data and bss per
// process. We use dedicated output sections for each process, i.e. we'd basically have six
// different output sections per process. At this point, we reach a technical limitation.
//   The linker allows repeatedly using the same output section names. We can have this
// sequence of output sections: .data (for P1), .bss (for P1), .data (for P2), .bss (for
// P2), ... However, the linker understands this as disrupted definition of one and the
// same output section; it'll produce one .data and .bss and the data and bss elements of
// one particular process don't form a single contiguous chunk of memory as we require.
// Effectively, the linker reorders the input sections with respect to their appearance in
// the linker script.
//   To get the needed ordering, we use different output section names by appending the
// process designation, e.g. .data.P1. Now the linker decides for different output sections
// and it places them into memory in order of appearance in the linker script. This is the
// desired memory layout.
//   The next technical limitation applies to the SDA sections only. If we rename the
// output sections, e.g. .sdata.P1, then the linker does no longer identify the output
// section as SDA addressed it refuses resolving according machine instructions (SDA21
// relocation error). We can't have more than one SDA addressed output section for data and
// bss.
//   The only way to still get adjacent data and bss memory chunks per process is placing
// both into the same output section, and - because of the data initialization requirement
// - this needs to be the data section. We don't use the bss output sections for SDA
// addressed data but place all data and all bss input sections into the data output
// section.
//   The unavoidable drawback is the waste of ROM space for the section image. All SDA
// addressed bss data is now part of the initialized data section and the image of the
// section in ROM grows accordingly. In the worst case this means a loss of ROM of 2*64k.
// In practice, it'll be much less as a good portion of the SDA data objects will anyway be
// initialized.
